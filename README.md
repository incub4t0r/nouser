## What is this?

This is a sample web application of providing a stateful web connection to visitors without having to register for an account. 

Users visit the page, which initializes a session token that expires in 31 days. Users can then input new crawl ids on a page, which simulate a post. These posts can then be viewed

There is a one to many relationship between a user and posts.

## But why

This is part of a larger project I am working on. Maybe one day I can use this for some future websites.
